Simple example which shows how to load 3d object and make them rotate in different way with kivy framework.
This example contains objloader module which may be used for loading 3d object from Wave format *.obj files to Kivy applications. It's extended version which allows you to load several object(see in code how to set object separator) and load also material information from *.mtl file which may be used while rendering.

This fork is the python 3 version (tested in Kivy-1.8.0-py3.3-win32).
